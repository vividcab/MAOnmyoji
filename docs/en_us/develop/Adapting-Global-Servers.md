# Foreign Server Adaptation

Currently, the foreign servers of 1999 can all switch to Chinese in the game settings. After modification, they are not much different from the domestic servers, so there isn't much adaptation work to be done.

## Resource Adaptation

Refer to [interface.json Writing](./Writing-interface.json.md#resource)

The main adaptations are for `startup.json` and `shutdown.json`.

Other issues will be addressed as they arise.
